If used in conjunction with the Student/Parent Handbook, it will answer some of the more common questions that arise. This handbook is general in nature and not intended to be comprehensive or to address all of the possible applications of, or exceptions to, the general policies and procedures described. TS reserves the right to modify, supplement, or rescind from time to time any of the policies, practices, and benefits described in this handbook as it deems appropriate in TS’s sole discretion with or without notice. Where applicable, the benefit plan documents will govern the administration of TS benefits.\n\nThis employee handbook is not an express or implied contract for employment or any purpose, and nothing contained in this handbook is intended or should be construed as a guarantee of employment or any benefit for any period of time. Except for those faculty and administrators employed pursuant to individual written employment contracts, employment at TS is “at-will,” which means that employment is not for a fixed term and may be terminated by TS or the employee at any time for any reason with or without notice.\n\nAfter reading these policies, any questions should be directed to your supervisor or the Director of Finance. TS employees are expected to follow all TS policies and guidelines. As set forth in more detail herein, failure to comply with the policies set forth in this handbook may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

        title: "History of The School",
        content: `In 1958 Professor and Mrs. L. Leon Bernard founded and opened the Cleland School – one of the first independent, tuition-supported schools in South Bend. Located in a little brown house on Eddy Street, the school was named in honor of Mrs. Bernard’s grandmother. In the first year students were accepted for kindergarten and first grade. Mrs. Bernard served as head of the School until 1963 and was a life trustee. Her children attended and graduated from the School.\n\nAs grades were added each year, Cleland moved into the Moose Lodge on Jefferson Boulevard and later onto the Fish Estate also located on Jefferson. In 1964 the Board of Trustees led by President Emeritus Ernestine M. Raclin purchased the Hoffman Estate at 3123 Miami Street which was the home of a former president of Studebaker Corporation. Due to the generosity of a prominent physician who practiced in the South Bend, Mishawaka, and Elkhart area, the name of the school was changed to TS. The Hoffman House was dedicated in honor of Mollie and Leon Bernard and is known today as Bernard Hall. After the completion of the second Capital Campaign, construction began which converted the estate into a school. Students and faculty occupied the school for the first time on November 9, 1965.\n\nAfter three subsequent Capital Campaigns, TS has grown in physical plant. Martin Hall became the center of the Middle School educational environment when a science, art, and music wing, along with two high school sized gymnasiums, were completed in February 1999, and an additional five classrooms were added in 2005. Fannin Hall, which also houses the Garatoni Center for Reggio Studies was added in 2006. Hiler Hall, housing grades three and four, an art room, a nurse’s office, administrative offices, and a new main entry and lobby, opened in 2014 and was made possible by Mrs. Margaret Hiler. TS is proud of its history, committed to its mission, and confident of a strong future.`

This policy governs all student-related decisions and employment decisions, including recruitment, hiring, job assignment, compensation, training, promotion, discipline, transfer, leave-of-absence, access to benefits, layoff, recall, termination and other personnel matters. All student-related and employment-related decisions are based solely upon legitimate, non-discriminatory factors.\n\nTS’s strong commitment to equal employment opportunity requires a commitment by each individual employee and student.

        content: `TS complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), as amended by the ADA Amendments Act (“ADAAA”), and all applicable state and local fair employment practices laws, and is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to qualified individuals with disabilities. Consistent with this commitment, TS will provide a reasonable accommodation to disabled applicants and employees if the reasonable accommodation would allow the individual to perform the essential functions of the job, unless doing so would create undue hardship.\n\nRequesting a Reasonable Accommodation\nIf you believe you need accommodation because of your disability, you are responsible for requesting a reasonable accommodation from TS. The request should be made in writing to your supervisor. TS encourages employees to make their request in writing and to include relevant information, such as:\n- A description of the accommodation you are requesting.\n- The reason you need an accommodation.\n- How the accommodation will help you perform the essential functions of your job.\nAfter receiving your oral or written request, TS will engage in an interactive dialogue with you to determine the precise limitations of your disability and explore potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations. TS encourages you to suggest specific reasonable accommodations that you believe would allow you to perform your job. However, TS is not required to make the specific accommodation requested by you and may provide an alternative, effective, accommodation, to the extent any reasonable accommodation can be made without imposing an undue hardship to TS.\n\nMedical Information\nIf your disability or need for accommodation is not obvious, TS may ask you to provide supporting documents showing that you have a disability within the meaning of the ADA and applicable state or local laws, and that your disability necessitates a reasonable accommodation. If the information provided in response to this request is insufficient, TS may require that you see a health care professional of TS’s choosing, at TS’s expense. In those cases, if you fail to provide the requested information or see the designated health care professional, your request for reasonable accommodation may be denied.\n\nDeterminations\nTS makes determinations about reasonable accommodations on a case-by-case basis considering various factors and based on an individualized assessment in each situation. TS strives to make determinations on reasonable accommodation requests expeditiously and will inform the individual once a determination has been made.\n\nNo Retaliation\nIndividuals will not be retaliated against for requesting an accommodation in good faith. TS expressly prohibits any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation or retaliation against any individual for requesting an accommodation in good faith. TS is committed to enforcing this policy and prohibiting retaliation against employees and applicants who request an accommodation in good faith. However, the effectiveness of our efforts depends largely on individuals telling us about inappropriate workplace conduct. If employees or applicants feel that they or someone else may have been subjected to conduct that violates this policy, they should report it immediately to TS. If employees do not report retaliatory conduct, TS may not become aware of a possible violation of this policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action.`

        title: "Non-Discrimination and Harassment",
        content: `TS is committed to providing a school environment that is free from all forms of discrimination and harassment. Harassment consists of unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical or visual, that is based upon or derisive of a person’s race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, veteran status, family medical history, genetic information or other legally protected characteristics or conduct, where the unwelcome conduct affects tangible job benefits, unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. All employees have a personal responsibility to keep the work place free of any such harassment.\n\nThis policy applies to any relationship or dealings that a TS employee has in the school or in connection with the performance of job duties. Therefore, the prohibition against harassment applies to employees, students, outside vendors, consultants, and others with whom we do business.\n\nSexual Harassment\nWhile all forms of harassment are strictly prohibited, TS emphasizes its prohibition of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is defined as unwanted sexual advances, or visual, verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature. This definition includes many forms of offensive behavior and includes harassment of a person of the same sex as the harasser. The following is a partial list of sexual harassment examples:\n- Unwanted sexual advances.\n- Offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors.\n- Making or threatening reprisals after a negative response to sexual advances.\n- Visual conduct that includes leering, making sexual gestures, or displaying of sexually suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons or posters.\n- Verbal conduct that includes making or using derogatory comments, epithets, slurs, or jokes.\n- Verbal sexual advances or propositions.\n- Verbal abuse of a sexual nature, graphic verbal commentaries about an individual’s body, sexually degrading words used to describe an individual, or suggestive or obscene letters, notes or invitations.\n- Physical conduct that includes touching, assaulting, or impeding or blocking movements.\nUnwelcome sexual advances (either verbal or physical), requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when: (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment; (2) submission or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for making employment decisions; or (3) the conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.\n\nOther Unlawful Harassment\nHarassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also prohibited. Under this policy, verbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his or her race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, veteran status, family medical history, genetic information or any other characteristic protected by law violates this policy. Harassing conduct includes, but is not limited to, the following conduct: making epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; and written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion and that is placed on walls or elsewhere on TS’s premises or circulated at TS.\n\nComplaint Procedure\nIf you experience or witness sexual or other unlawful harassment at TS, report it immediately to your supervisor. If your supervisor is unavailable or if you are uncomfortable contacting that person, you should immediately report this harassment to the Head of School, or any school administrator. All allegations of sexual harassment and other unlawful harassment will be quickly and discreetly investigated. The investigation may include interviews with the person making the complaint, the person against whom the complaint is made, any potential witnesses identified by either person, or any person whom TS believes has relevant information. To the extent possible, your confidentiality and that of any witnesses and the alleged harasser will be protected against unnecessary disclosure. The results of the investigation will be discussed with the person who made the complaint, and appropriate disciplinary action, if any, will be taken, up to and including termination.\n\nNo Retaliation\nTS will not permit retaliation against anyone who complains or participates in the investigation. If an individual attempts to retaliate, severe discipline, up to and including termination, will be imposed. If any individual believes that he or she has been retaliated against for exercising his or her rights under this policy, the employee should report such conduct using the complaint procedure set forth above.\n\nFalse Accusations Prohibited\nBecause false accusations may have serious impact on the person accused, any employee who makes a complaint that he or she knows to be false will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n\nDiscipline\nAnyone engaging in sexual or other unlawful harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.`

Many employees employed by TS as faculty or administrators are employed pursuant to individual employment contracts. All such contracts are in writing and are individual contracts between TS and a particular employee. Renewal of such contracts is at the discretion of TS and typically depends on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, evaluation of performance by a supervisor. Any employee employed by TS who is not a party to such a written contract is employed ‘at will’.\n\nExcept for those faculty and administrators employed pursuant to written employment contracts as described above, TS maintains an “at-will” environment. That is to say that TS, at its own discretion, reserves the right to adjust or reduce its work force in the event that there should be insufficient work or when economic, organizational, or programmatic considerations warrant that employees be transferred, laid off, or released from employment.

For the benefit of all employees, the school, and its students, in furthering these interests and enforcing TS’s policies, applicants who have received a conditional offer of employment at TS are required to authorize TS to obtain various background checks in accordance with Indiana law. The background checks will include the following:\n- An expanded criminal history check for each applicant for employment who is likely to have direct, ongoing contact with children within the scope of the individual's employment before or not later than thirty (30) days after the start date of the applicant's employment with TS.\n- An expanded child protection index check for each applicant for employment who is likely to have direct, ongoing contact with children within the scope of the individual's employment before or not later than sixty (60) days after the start date of the applicant’s employment by TS.\n- An expanded criminal history check for all employees of TS every five (5) years.\nAn applicant or employee may be responsible for all the costs associated with obtaining the expanded criminal history check and the expanded child protection index check. Typically, an employee will not be required to obtain an expanded criminal history check more than one (1) time in a five (5) year period. However, if at any time TS has reason to believe the employee is the subject of a substantiated report of child abuse or neglect or has been charged with or convicted of a crime listed in Indiana Code § 20-26-5-11, then that employee will be required to obtain an expanded criminal history check and the expanded child protection index check.\n\nThe information contained in the expanded criminal history check and the expanded child protection index check may be obtained by a consumer reporting agency from public record sources or through personal interviews with co-workers, neighbors, friends, associates, current or former employers, or other personal acquaintances. Any information contained in such reports may be taken into consideration in evaluating suitability for employment, promotion, reassignment or retention as an employee.\n\nAll employees must report any arrests or changes to their criminal background to the Head of School and Director of Finance within 24 hours of the occurrence so that the school can determine whether the employee’s status should change. Failure to do so may result in termination of employment.`

TS’s Workplace Conduct Policy (“Code”) requires trustees, officers and employees to observe high standards of business and personal ethics in the conduct of their duties and responsibilities. As employees and representatives of the school, we must practice honesty and integrity in fulfilling our responsibilities and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nReporting Responsibility\nIt is the responsibility of all trustees, officers and employees to comply with the Code and to report violations or suspected violations in accordance with this Whistleblower Policy.\n\nNo Retaliation\nNo trustee, officer or employee who in good faith reports a violation of the Code shall suffer harassment, retaliation or adverse employment consequence.

This Whistleblower Policy is intended to encourage and enable employees and others to raise serious concerns within TS prior to seeking resolution outside TS.\n\nReporting Violations\nThe Code addresses TS’s Open Door Policy and suggests that employees share their questions, concerns, suggestions, or complaints with someone who can address them properly. In most cases, an employee’s supervisor is in the best position to address an area of concern. However, if you are not comfortable speaking with your supervisor or you are not satisfied with your supervisor’s response, you are encouraged to speak with someone in the human resources department/business office or anyone in management whom you are comfortable approaching. Supervisors and managers are required to report suspected violations of the Code to TS’s compliance officer, who has specific and exclusive responsibility to investigate all reported violations.

TS’s compliance officer is the chair of the Audit Committee.\n\nAccounting and Auditing Matters\nThe Audit Committee of the board of trustees shall address all reported concerns or complaints regarding corporate accounting practices, internal controls or auditing. The compliance officer shall immediately notify the Audit Committee of any such complaint and work with the committee until the matter is resolved.\n\nActing in Good Faith\nAnyone filing a complaint concerning a violation or suspected violation of the Code must be acting in good faith and have reasonable grounds for believing the information disclosed indicates a violation of the Code. Any allegations that prove not to be substantiated and which prove to have been made maliciously or knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious disciplinary offense.\n\nConfidentiality\nViolations or suspected violations may be submitted on a confidential basis by the complainant or may be submitted anonymously. Reports or violations or suspected violations will be kept confidential to the extent possible, consistent with the need to conduct an adequate investigation.\n\nHandling of Reported Violations\nThe compliance officer will promptly notify the sender and acknowledge receipt of the reported violation or suspected violation. All reports will be promptly investigated and appropriate corrective action will be taken if warranted by the investigation.\n\nContact Information\nAudit Committee Compliance Officer: See school directory for the current Finance Committee Chair.\nManagement Staff includes Director of Finance and Head of School.`

Failure on the part of employees to follow this policy can result in possible civil and criminal sanctions against the school and its employees and possible disciplinary action against responsible individuals (up to and including termination of employment).

        title: "Employment Classifications",
        content: `All employees matter greatly and there is no intent to declare hierarchies as to value. However, TS must provide basic definitions and categories in order to comply with applicable laws.\n\nMost faculty members are 10-month employees while most non-instructional staff members are 12-month employees, depending on the requirements of their position. Faculty and staff members can also be further classified as exempt or non-exempt, part-time, full time, seasonal or temporary (see below for definition of categories). TS will conduct all compensation practices in compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nTS maintains standard definitions of employment and classifications for purposes of personnel administration and related payroll transactions according to the following definitions.\n\nExempt employees are those whose positions meet specific requirements established by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Exempt employees are paid a salary for all hours worked which is not subject to deductions for variations in the quantity or quality of the work performed. Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime pay. FLSA defines exempt employees based on minimum salary requirements and job duties described in three main categories: executive, professional, and administrative employees who exercise independent judgment and discretion around matters of significance.\n\nNon-exempt employees are those whose positions do not meet the FLSA exemption requirements. Non-exempt employees may be paid on an hourly or salaried basis but will be paid overtime at a rate of one and one-half times the employee’s regular rate for hours worked in excess of 40 per workweek in accordance with applicable law.\n\nFull-Time, 12 Month Employees\nAn employee who is hired to work an average of thirty (30) hours per week (or at least 1,560 annual hours) during the entire twelve months of the year is considered a full-time, 12 month employee. Generally, full-time 12-month employees are eligible to receive the benefits described in this Handbook, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program.\n\nFull-Time, School-Year Only Employees\nAn employee who is hired to work an average of thirty (30) hours per week each week during the time the school is in session for the academic year (or 1,320 hours) is considered a full-time, school-year-only employee. An academic year is defined as 44 weeks. Generally, full-time school-year-only employees are eligible to receive the benefits described in this Handbook, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program.\n\nPart-Time, 12 Month Employees\nAn employee who is hired to work an average of twenty (20) or more, but less than thirty (30) hours per week during the entire twelve months of the year is considered a part-time, 12 month employee. Total annual hours worked are between 1,040 and less than 1,560 hours. Generally, part-time, 12 month employees are eligible to receive certain benefits described in this Handbook, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program.\n\nPart-Time, School-Year-Only Employees\nAn employee who is hired to work an average of twenty (20) or more, but less than thirty (30) hours per week each week during the time the school is in session for the academic year is considered a part-time, school-year-only employee. Total hours worked are between 880 and 1,319 hours. An academic year is defined as 44 weeks. These employees are not eligible for fringe benefits, except as specifically provided in this Handbook or as required by law.\n\nBus drivers are also considered part-time, school-year-only employees.\n\nTemporary or Seasonal Employees\nTemporary or seasonal employees are those who are hired for a pre-established brief period, usually during peak workloads or for vacation relief or to cover another employee’s leave of absence.\n\nContracted Faculty or Instructional Employees\nTS generally issues a written contract to instructional employees. Each contract will indicate the faculty member’s basic responsibilities for the coming year. Faculty duties include, but are not limited to, participation in daily teaching duties, lunch and recess duties, field trips, supervision of students, study halls, advising, coaching athletics or student activities. Employees may be asked from time to time to attend special events held on behalf of the school. Faculty who have been issued a contract for the following school year should return their signed contract within a 2 week window of receipt of contract. If the contract is not returned by that date and without prior approval of the Head of School then the school may elect to hire a replacement for that individual.`

        content: `TS compensates employees for all time worked. All non-exempt employees, including hourly and non-exempt salaried employees, are required to accurately record all time worked (regardless of the location where the work occurs). Employees are only permitted to record their own time and are not permitted to clock in or out for another employee. Supervisors and/or the Director of Finance review the recorded time each pay period. Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\nSupervisors will authorize overtime, sick leave, vacation, and miscellaneous leave for each employee. Supervisors may require employees to work overtime; however, no non-exempt employee may work overtime without the prior approval of the supervisor. Overtime is defined as follows: For hourly and non-exempt salaried employees, any hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week from Monday through Sunday. The rate of pay for overtime hours is one and one-half times the regular base rate, in accordance with U.S. Department of Labor regulations. Time off from work for holiday, vacation, or sick leave does not count as hours worked for purposes of determining whether overtime compensation is due.\n\nNon-exempt employees must accurately record time worked. Non-exempt employees should not work any hours that are not authorized by their supervisor. Non-exempt employees should not start work early, finish work late, work during a meal break or perform any other extra or overtime work unless authorized to do so and that time is recorded. Non-exempt employees are prohibited from performing any “off-the-clock” work, i.e., work performed but not reported on the time card. Any employee who fails to report or inaccurately reports any hours worked will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Employees should report time worked off campus to their supervisor. During summer hours, non-exempt office staff work six hours (9am-3pm) and can take a lunch break extending the work day to 4pm, as long as the employee arranges their own lunch coverage.\n\nTS makes every effort to pay its employees correctly. Occasionally, however, mistakes are possible. When mistakes do happen and are called to the School’s attention, TS will make every effort to promptly make necessary corrections. Employees should review their pay stubs online to confirm that they have been properly paid. See the Director of Finance on how to access this online system.\n\nIf an employee has questions about pay, or believes he or she has been subject to any improper deductions or his pay does not accurately reflect the employee’s hours worked, or if an employee has any other concerns about any other pay-related issues, the employee should immediately report the matter to the Director of Finance. All inquiries and concerns will be promptly addressed. TS prohibits retaliation against employees who report alleged FLSA violations or cooperate in any investigation of such reports.`

        title: "Separation from Employment",
        content: `Termination of employment is an inevitable part of personnel activity within any organization, and many of the reasons for termination are routine. Below are examples of some of the most common circumstances under which employment is terminated:\nRESIGNATION: Voluntary employment termination initiated by an employee.\nDISCHARGE: Involuntary employment termination initiated by the organization.\nRETIREMENT: Voluntary employment termination initiated by the employee meeting age, length of service, and other criteria for retirement from the organization.\n\nCompleting an employment agreement is certainly expected, however, all employees are free to resign at any time. Similarly, TS is free to terminate employment of “at will” employees at any time. Although advance notice is not required, TS requests at least two weeks' written resignation notice from all employees.\n\nContract employees may be terminated as outlined in his/her contract, including for: (a) immorality; (b) insubordination, including but not limited to, a willful refusal to confirm to all rules and policies of TS or to direction or instruction from the Head of School; (c) neglect of duties as required by the Contract and any applicable job description; (d) substantial inability to perform teaching duties; (e) decrease in the number of teaching positions and/or enrollment; or (f) good and just cause, including but not limited to, any conduct which, in the sole discretion of TS, is distractive from or disruptive to the school community. Contract employees have no right to renewal of a contract, and renewal decisions are within the sole discretion of the Head of School.\n\nTS will generally schedule exit interviews at the time of termination. The exit interview will serve two purposes. The first is to discuss issues such as continuation of employee benefits, references, repayment of any outstanding debts to the school, and return of school-owned property such as computers and fobs and keys to your classroom and building. The second purpose is for the school to learn about the departing employee’s experience at the school, with the intent to grow and learn as an institution through their experiences. The exit interview will be performed by the Director of Finance who also manages HR at the school.\n\nFor all employees, both faculty and staff, the last day worked for the school is the effective date of termination. When an employee leaves TS, his/her final paycheck will be issued on the next regular pay date. For non-returning faculty, accrued summer pay will be paid out in June and benefits will end at the end of June. If an employee is on benefits at the time of separation, s/he is given a list of those benefits and information on how to continue them on an individual basis if applicable. Unless converted to individual policies, where permitted, medical, dental, vision, life and long-term disability coverage ceases on the last day of the month during which employment ceases.\n\nTS is required by federal law (COBRA --Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) to extend to separated employees, at the former employees’ expense, certain benefits received while employed at TS; this extension of benefits is only for a limited period of time (usually eighteen months). Once employment with TS ends, TS is released from any further financial or legal obligations to the staff employee (excluding COBRA requirements). Employees are responsible for notifying the employer of a COBRA qualifying event.`

Part-time employee eligibility is based on the number of hours worked or as required by law. Temporary employees may be eligible for benefits depending on the assigned work schedule.\n\nAffordable Care Act requirements apply for medical insurance eligibility for part time employees who may not be otherwise eligible for the full benefits package.\n\nAll new full-time employees are eligible for the following benefits beginning the first of the month following date of hire.`

        title: "Summary of Employee Benefits",
        content: `Group Health Insurance\nGroup health benefits include medical, dental and vision coverage. Due to the relatively small number of participants these benefits cannot be taken individually. Full-time employees (both 12 month and school-year-only) working 30 or more hours per week (or 1,320 annual hours) are eligible for health benefits. Coverage will begin on the first day of the month following a 30-day waiting period from the date of hire. The school pays 70% of the total cost for single employee coverage. The school’s contribution for dependent coverage is 40% of the difference between the total cost of single coverage and dependent coverage. The employee’s contribution to the health coverage may also be deducted on a “pre-tax” basis. Participation in this plan is irrevocable for a period of one-year. If you elect not to participate and opt-out of the program upon employment, you will be eligible to participate during the school’s open enrollment period in June of the following year with benefits starting on July 1. You may however, qualify to enroll into the program if you experience one of the following qualifying events during a benefit year:\n- Divorce or legal separation\n- Marriage\n- Birth/adoption of a child\n- Death\n- Spouse terminates employment\n- Spouse’s employment status changes from full-time to part-time and loss of health benefits results.\nYou must notify the Business Office within 30 days of any of the above events to be enrolled in the health benefits program. The Plan Year for this program is July 1 through June 30.\n\nEmployer Matching Retirement Plan\nTS Retirement Plan is a defined contribution/tax-deferred annuity plan under Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Service Code whereby the employer will match a minimum percentage of the employee’s salary. An employee is eligible for the employer match following one year of service at TS and works at least 1,000 hours annually. The plan is currently funded through Teachers Insurance Annuity Association (TIAA). Eligible new employees, who have previously been enrolled in a TIAA plan with a former educational institution, will be eligible to receive the school's matching contribution upon hire. Employee contributions are tax-deferred, i.e. are taken on a "pre-tax basis". Employees not eligible to receive the employer match until after one year of service or part-time employees (both 12 month and school-year-only) working 20 hours per week (or at least 880 hours annually) are eligible to participate in the voluntary tax-deferred plan (not to exceed IRS limitations) upon employment.\n\nFlexible Spending Benefits/Pre-Tax Reimbursements\nEmployees (both 12 month and school-year-only) working at least 20 hours per week or 880 annual hours are eligible to participate in an employee funded Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Program. Heath Care FSA’s allow employees to set aside “pre-tax” dollars to pay health care costs not reimbursed through any insurance plan while Dependent Care FSA’s allow employees to set aside “pre-tax” dollars to pay dependent care expenses incurred to enable the employee and spouse, if married, to work. Refer to IRS regulations regarding maximum deferral limitations. Eligible health care expenses may include medical, dental and vision insurance deductibles, co-payments and any out-of-pocket health care costs. According to IRS regulations, if eligible expenses are less than your annual election for the plan year, the remaining amount is forfeited.\n\nLife Insurance\nEmployees (both 12 month and school-year-only) working at least 20 hours per week or 880 annual hours receive life insurance coverage with a face value equal to two times annual salary to a maximum of $50,000. TS provides the cost of this benefit.\n\nEarly Retirement Health Benefits\nEmployees choosing to retire from TS before age 65, and who are participating in the group health plan, but are not yet eligible for Medicare benefits may have the option of staying on TS’s health plan after retirement, at their own cost, until they become eligible for Medicare. Full-time employees (working at least 30 hours per week or 1,320 annual hours) who choose to retire before the age of 65 may continue coverage under TS’s health insurance plan at his or her own expense, if, at the time of retirement, the employee is at least age 60 and has a combination of age and service years adding up to at least eighty (80). Eligibility for this continuation in coverage will last until the employee becomes eligible for Medicare. Coverage will end earlier if the employee fails to make timely payment of the required premium in accordance with the rules and procedures established by TS.\n\nContinuation of Benefits (COBRA)\nFederal law (COBRA) gives you, your spouse, and your dependents the opportunity to continue medical coverage at group rates for a specified period of time after certain qualifying events occur. You have the right to choose this continuation coverage if you lose your group medical coverage because of a reduction in your hours of employment or the termination of your employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct). The school will inform you of your rights in this case.\n\nWorker’s Compensation\nAll employees are covered by Worker’s Compensation Insurance for certain injuries or illnesses that occur at or in the course of your work at TS. The total cost of this insurance is paid by TS. Coverage applies to most medical charges and may provide partial payment for lost wages. If you are injured while at work, you must report to the Director of Finance immediately in order to have a claim made for benefits. All employees with work related injuries should report to the Beacon Medpoint Urgent Care facility at 1815 Ireland Road, South Bend, IN 46614; (574) 647-1750.\n\nUnemployment Compensation\nTS participates in the state unemployment program through its self-insurance program. State law determines the amount and duration of benefits for which an employee may be eligible.\n\nTuition Payments via Payroll Deduction\nEmployees with children attending TS may pay for the cost of this tuition via payroll deduction. Tuition payments will be made over 26 pay periods, July through June. See the Director of Finance for specific details.\n\nCompensation Pay for Faculty Overnight Trips\nEmployees who supervise the overnight trip in 5th and 6th grade, are given one extra personal day to use. Employees supervising the 7th and 8th grade trips will receive 2 personal days due to the extended length of the trip. Employees electing the paid personal day should complete an “Employee Absence Form” and obtain Head of School approval prior to scheduling the day off.\n\nVaccinations/CPR Training\nTS provides flu shots, Hepatitis B vaccine, and CPR training to employees.\n\nAdvanced Degree Reimbursement\nFull-time employees (working over 30 hours/week) wishing to pursue a single master’s and/or doctoral degree in their field of study, may be reimbursed up to $500/semester or $1,000/year maximum upon successful completion of the course with a grade of B or higher. All other professional development taken during that same year will be payable at the employee’s own expense or at the discretion of the Head of School. Due to professional development priorities that vary from year to year, decisions will be made on an annual basis, must be requested by September 1, and prior to applying to the program if reimbursement is sought. Receipts for completed coursework must be received within the year the course is completed.\n\nRetiring Employee Appreciation Gifts\nEffective for employees hired prior to July 1, 2014, the Board has approved at the time of retirement the following as appropriate ways for the school to show its appreciation for years of service. Appreciation gifts that allow the opportunity for parents to contribute to either a “purse” (personal cash gift) or to a “designated” school item are directed through the Advancement Office. Employees receiving “personal cash gifts” are required to report this income on their individual tax returns and will receive a federal tax form 1099 substantiating the amount received during the calendar year in which the personal gift was received. For appreciation gifts “designated” to the school, the retiring employee must designate gifts made on their behalf within one year of retirement.`

Employees (both 12-month and school-year-only) working at least 880 annual hours are eligible to accumulate sick leave. Included in the definition of sick leave are absences for reasons clearly beyond the control of the employee: personal illness, illness or death of an immediate family member and/or the sudden, serious illness of a family member which necessitates an employee being at home to make arrangements. Household appointments for emergencies that are beyond the employee’s control may be approved by the direct supervisor as sick time. A doctor or nurse’s certificate will be required for time missed over three consecutive working days. In the case of repeated, short-term absences that are not approved as FMLA leave (see below) a doctor or nurse’s certificate also will be required.

Once an employee has exhausted his or her sick days and is eligible for Short Term Disability Leave (STD) due to his/her own illness, a request for such leave should be submitted to the business office. It is recommended that the STD leave requests be submitted as soon as possible so there will be no interruption of pay. Unused sick days can be carried over from year to year, up to the maximums outlined in the Summary below. Employees will not be paid for any unused sick leave upon termination or retirement of their work relationship with the school.\n\nPersonal Days\nEmployees (except temporary/seasonal employees) are allowed 2 personal days each year. Personal days may not be accrued year to year. Taking additional days beyond the allotted amount must be approved by the direct supervisor and will be unpaid. Planned personal day absences in all divisions should be submitted in writing to the Division Director with as much notice as possible for approval by the supervisor prior to submitting an Absence Form. An “Employee Absence Form” should be submitted following written approval by the supervisor. Generally, personal days taken directly before or after school breaks are prohibited except in extenuating circumstances. In the event of such a circumstance, written requests must be submitted to the supervisor for approval.\n\nProfessional Development Days\nTS values and promotes continuing professional growth for its employees, whether through conference attendance or workshop leadership. Participation in professional development activities for which a teacher misses work days must be approved by and coordinated with the appropriate Division Director and are contingent upon available funds. Days away from campus for professional development are typically limited to 5 per academic year and will neither count toward nor are deducted from the accumulated sick days. Planned professional development day absences in all divisions should be submitted in writing to the Division Director with as much notice as possible for approval prior to submitting an Absence Form.\n\nFunerals/Bereavement\nIn the unfortunate event of a death in the immediate family the supervisor will grant bereavement leave for up to five calendar days without the loss of pay. If an employee needs more time, he/she may request an unpaid extended absence. Immediate family shall include spouse, children, stepchildren, parents (including in-laws and step parents), siblings (step-siblings), grandparents and grandchildren.\n\nJury Duty\nAn employee receiving a summons for jury duty shall notify his/her supervisor immediately. In cases of absence from work in response to a jury summons, the employee will be on a paid leave. The school will be responsible for payment of a substitute for the period of the absence, but the employee is expected to sign any remittance from the court over to TS.\n\nReligious Observance\nBenefits eligible employees may take scheduled time off for cultural or religious holidays and observances without that time counting as personal time or other paid time off. This policy is designed to affirm TS’s commitment to an inclusive environment.`

        title: "Disability Leave",
        content: `Overview\nIn the event that an employee working at least 880 annual hours becomes totally disabled, the school will pay full salary from the date of total disability until sick leave is exhausted. At that point, the school will pay 60% of salary plus full fringe benefits until six months have elapsed from the date of total disability. After six months, an outside provider will provide long-term disability benefits.\n\nDefinitions:\nActive-at-Work – performing regular duties of a scheduled work day on a regular basis at TS.\nBasic Earnings – straight-time hourly rate of pay, if applicable, or equivalent times hours regularly assigned during a normal workweek. Basic earnings do not include overtime or other additional pay.\nElimination Period – TS will provide STD benefits upon notice of a disability and after use of your accumulated sick days. If a disability ceases for up to 14 days and begins again due to the same sickness or injury, the period of disability will be deemed continuous.\nFringe Benefits – TS will continue to pay its portion of health, retirement, and life benefits while on STD leave. The employee is responsible for his/her co-payment of these benefits and other payroll related deductions.\nInjury – any accidental bodily injury.\nPre-Existing Condition – any injury or illness for which you incurred expenses, consulted a physician, received medical treatment or services including diagnostic measures, or took prescribed drugs or medicine for treatment at any time prior to your effective date for STD coverage.\nRetirement Plan – a plan, which provides your retirement, benefits and which is not funded wholly by your contributions.

You are eligible for participation in the STD coverage on the day you complete a waiting period of 90 days from your date of hire. Your date of hire is the first day you became active-at-work. STD benefits begin on your first regular payroll date after the Elimination Period provided that the school receives satisfactory proof that you became disabled while you were insured for this benefit, and your disability continued through and after the Elimination Period. The Elimination Period is defined as the period in which an employee receives their accumulated sick days as payment during their initial days of disability. Short Term Disability is an amount equal to 60% of your monthly Basic Earnings not to exceed $10,000 per month or less other income benefits. Other income benefits include:\n- Payments under any group disability plan or like-plan for persons in a group.\n- Payments under the United States Social Security Act or Railroad Retirement Act, the Canadian Pension Plan, or the Quebec Pension Plan or any similar plan or act, including such payments to your dependents.\n- Payments under any government Retirement Plan.\n- Payments under any Workers' Compensation or like law, including any such payments to your dependents.\n- Payments under any compulsory act or law.\n- Payments under a Retirement Plan.\n- Payments from earnings from other occupations.\nRecipients of benefits under the STD policy must notify the Director of Finance of other income benefits received. Recipients of STD benefits who fail to disclose such income forfeit future benefits and must repay benefits to TS. An employee must submit notification in writing requesting STD leave.

        title: "Family and Medical Leave Act",
        content: `Instructional and Non-Instructional Employees\nAny employee who has been employed by TS for at least one year and has worked at least 1,250 hours during the past twelve (12) months is eligible for benefits under the Family and Medical Leave Act based on a rolling twelve (12) month period.\n\nEssentially, eligible employees are entitled to a maximum of twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave to:\n- To care for the employee’s child after the birth of that child or to care for a child placed with the employee for adoption or foster care (hereinafter referred to as “New Child Leave”); and/or\n- To care for the employee’s spouse, child or parent who has a “serious health condition” (hereinafter referred to as “Family Medical Leave”); and/or\n- To care for the employee’s own “serious health condition” which renders the employee unable to perform his or her job (hereinafter referred to as “Employee Medical Leave”).\n\nSerious Health Condition\nA “serious health condition” means an injury, illness, impairment or physical or mental condition that involves at least one of the following:\n- In-patient care.\n- Incapacity causing absence of more than three (3) calendar days from work, school or other regular activities and continuing treatment by a health care provider.\n- Continuing treatment by a health care provider means treatment two or more times for an injury or illness or treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of a health care provider.\n- Treatment by a health care provider for a chronic or long-term health condition.\n- Prenatal care or incapacity related to pregnancy.\n- Excluded are voluntary or cosmetic treatments which are not medically necessary and routine preventive physical examinations.\nIn the event of an illness, the time may be taken intermittently in increments of an hour up to the maximum 12-week time period or on a reduced leave basis. In the case of childcare, the time taken must be continuous.\n\nGroup Medical Insurance\nTS will continue to provide health benefits to the same extent as an active employee during the leave of absence. The employee is responsible for the appropriate premiums, co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses as a similarly situated active employee. Any employee not returning to the employment of TS following a leave under this provision, except for reasons of an on-going illness, will be required to reimburse TS for the appropriate premiums within 30 days.\n\nExhaustion of Paid Time Off as Part of Leave\nEmployees are required to use, at the beginning of an FMLA Leave, any unused paid personal or sick days they may have available, but they may retain at least five (5) days of accrued paid time off. Employees will be required to use these unused paid personal and sick days unless or until another paid leave program applies (for example, the employee becomes eligible for paid leave time under worker’s compensation or disability insurance) at which point they may not be required to use any further available paid days off. All paid time-off days used will count as part of the 12-week FMLA leave available to employees.\n\nRequest for Leave\nAny employee who desires a leave of absence under this policy must complete, sign and submit a Request for Leave of Absence form to the Director of Finance (with the approval of the Head of School). When the need for a leave of absence is foreseeable or anticipated, such as planned medical treatment or the birth or adoption of a child, the employee must make reasonable efforts to schedule the leave so as not to disrupt TS’s operations and must submit the Request for Leave of Absence not less than thirty (30) days before the date the leave is to begin. If the Leave is not foreseeable, the employee must submit the application as far in advance as possible.\n\nMedical Certification\nA written medical certification from a healthcare provider must accompany every Request for Leave of Absence except for requests for leave based on the birth of a child; the placement of a child for adoption or foster care; or a medical emergency. The certification must state: (1) the date on which the serious medical condition began; (2) the probable duration of the condition; and (3) the appropriate medical facts regarding the condition and its duration. A medical certification form may be obtained from the Business Office and must be submitted within 15 days of the school’s request to the employee for this certification. The school reserves the right to require a second opinion from another health care provider. If the basis for the request is an employee’s own serious health condition, the written medical certification must also include a statement that the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his/her position. If the basis of the proposed leave is the serious health condition of a spouse, child, or parent, the written medical certification must include a statement that the employee is needed to care for the spouse, child or parent, as well as an estimate of the amount of time the employee is needed to provide the care. In emergency situations, employees will not be required to initially provide proof of a “serious health condition.” However, employees may be required to provide a status report at four (4) week intervals. A second and/or third opinion may be requested at the expense of TS.\n\nOutside Employment\nAn employee taking an approved leave of absence may not engage in other work or employment during the leave without written consent of TS. If an employee engages in unauthorized work or employment during the leave of absence, the employee will be considered to have violated the terms of the leave, and to have voluntarily terminated his/her employment with TS (this applies to employees on paid leaves of absence as well).\n\nReinstatement\nAn employee returning from an approved leave resulting from his/her own serious health condition must provide a written medical certification from the healthcare provider stating that he/she is able to perform the essential functions of his/her job with or without reasonable accommodations. TS will consider any opinions or recommendations from healthcare providers regarding reasonable accommodation as part of its analysis for reasonable accommodations. Employees will be restored to their prior position or an equivalent position following return from FMLA leave unless business necessity makes this impossible or unreasonable. An employee not intending to return after the completion of leave shall provide the school with at least one week’s notice of intent not to return after leave. Failure to return to work on the scheduled date of return will indicate that the employee has resigned their employment with the School.\n\nCompensation\nThe guidelines covering compensation to an employee for any part of an approved leave of absence will be outlined in this Handbook. Nothing in this policy will require TS to increase the amount or type of paid leave, if any.\n\nSpouses Working for the Same Employer\nWhen spouses work for the same employer and each spouse is eligible to take FMLA leave, the FMLA limits the combined amount of leave they may take for some, but not all, FMLA-qualifying leave reasons. Eligible spouses are limited to a combined total of 12 workweeks of leave in a 12- month period for the following FMLA-qualifying reasons:\n- the birth of a son or daughter and bonding with the newborn child,\n- the placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care and bonding with the newly-placed child, and\n- the care of a parent with a serious health condition.\nEligible spouses who work for the same employer are each entitled to up to 12 workweeks of FMLA in a 12-month period, without regard to the amount of leave their spouses use, for the following FMLA-qualifying reasons:\n- the care of a spouse or son or daughter with a serious health condition;\n- a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions or his or her job, and\n- any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son daughter or parent is a military member on “covered active duty”.\n\nInstructional Employees Only\nIt is the intent of TS to encourage and support the return of all employees to his/her assigned functions as soon as possible. However, TS may find it necessary to invoke the following options as they relate to instructional employees. For the purposes of this document, instructional employees are defined as employees with an annually renewable contract to teach. If an instructional employee’s intermittent leave covers more than 20% of the total working days over the period the leave extends, TS may require the employee to take leave not to exceed the duration of the planned treatment or, if available, temporarily transferring to another position for which the employee is qualified and which carries equivalent pay and benefits. Additionally, you may be required to remain on leave until the end of the term in any of the following three situations:\n- The leave begins more than five weeks prior to the end of a term and the leave will last a minimum of three weeks with the employee returning to work during the three-week period prior to the end of the term.\n- The leave begins during the five-week period before the end of the term, will last more than two weeks, is requested for a purpose other than the employees’ own serious health condition and will end during the two-week period before the end of the term.\n- The leave is requested for a purpose other than the employee’s own serious health condition, during the three-week period before the end of the term and will last for more than five working days.`

        content: `Service Member Family and Medical Leave\nThe federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) now entitles eligible employees to take leave for a covered family member’s service in the Armed Forces (“Service member FMLA”). This policy supplements TS’s FMLA policy and provides general notice of employee rights to such leave. Except as mentioned below, an employee’s rights and obligations to Service member FMLA leave are governed by our existing FMLA policy.\n\nLeave Entitlement\nService member FMLA provides eligible employees unpaid leave for any one, or for a combination, of the following reasons:\n- A “qualifying exigency” (as defined by applicable Department of Labor regulation) arising out of a fact that the spouse, son, daughter or parent of the employee is on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty in the Armed Forces (Qualifying Exigency Leave); and/or\n- To care for a covered family member who has incurred a serious injury or illness in the line of duty while on active duty in the Armed Forces provided that such injury or illness may render the family member unfit to perform duties of the member’s office, grade, rank or rating (Service Member Leave).\n\nDuration of Service member FMLA\nWhen Leave Is Due To A “Qualifying Exigency”: An eligible employee may take up to 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period. When Leave Is To Care For An Injured or Ill Service Member: An eligible employee may take up to 26 workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for the service member. Leave to care for an injured or ill service member, when combined with other FMLA-qualifying leave, may not exceed 26 weeks in a single 12-month period. Service member leave runs concurrent with other leave entitlements provided under federal, state and local law.\n\nEligible Employees\nAn employee is eligible for service member leave to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness if, in addition to meeting the normal FMLA eligibility requirements listed in the policy, they are the spouse, son, daughter, or next of kin of a covered service member who is needed to care for the service member.\n\nSerious Injury or Illness\nA member of the Armed Forces is said to suffer from a “serious injury or illness” if they have incurred such injury or illness in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces that may render the member medically unfit to perform the duties of the member’s office, grade, rank or rating.\n\nNotice by Employees\nAn employee requesting leave pursuant to service member leave for active duty of a family member must provide as much prior notice to TS as is reasonable and practical under the circumstances. In addition, the eligible employee must provide a certification and/or documentation of the call to active duty.\n\nFinal Note\nIt is not the intent of this explanation to be an in-depth discussion of the provision of the FMLA but to alert employees to their rights under the Act and of TS’s intent to adhere to the requirements of the FMLA. If you consider applying for a leave of absence under the FMLA, please see the Director of Finance for a full explanation of your rights under the FMLA.\n\nIndiana Military Family Leave Act\nUnder Indiana law, employees who have been employed by TS for at least twelve (12) months and have worked at least 1,500 hours during the past twelve (12) months are eligible for military family leave. Employees may take this leave when a spouse, parent, grandparent or sibling of the employee is ordered to active duty. The employee may take a leave of absence during one or more of the following periods:\n- during the thirty-day period before the family member’s active duty orders are in effect;\n- during a period in which the family member ordered to active duty is on leave while active duty orders are in effect; or\n- during the thirty-day period after the family member’s active duty orders are terminated.\nEmployees are allowed to take up to ten (10) days of unpaid military family leave each year. TS may require employees taking military family leave to take any earned paid vacation leave or personal leave for any part of the military family leave requested by the employee to run concurrently with that period. An employee who wants to take a military family leave of absence must provide TS with 30 days written notice (if practicable), including a copy of the family member’s active duty orders if available. If an employee fails to provide TS with verification of the employee’s eligibility for leave, TS may consider the employee’s absence to be unexcused.`

        content: `The School has adopted this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”) applicable to all employees. It is intended to work in conjunction with the Policy on Conflicts of Interest signed by senior administrators, key employees and members of the Board of Trustees (the “Conflict of Interest Policy”). To the extent there is any conflict between the Conflict of Interest Policy and the Code, the Conflict of Interest Policy shall control.\n\nIn implementing this Code, it is TS’s intention to take all measures necessary to promote and ensure honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of conflicts of interest; full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in all financial reports prepared or distributed by TS; and compliance with applicable laws and governmental regulations. This Code also is intended to provide directives and procedures that: (1) protect TS’s legally protectable interests, including any business-related opportunities, assets, and/or confidential information of TS; (2) protect TS from incurring unauthorized or unnecessary contractual or other liability; (3) deter any employee from the commission of any wrongful act associated in any way with TS; and (4) provide a mechanism for prompt and consistent enforcement of the provisions of this Code. All employees are expected to be familiar with this Code and to adhere to the principles and procedures set forth in this Code.\n\nHonest and Candid Conduct\nTS is succeeding in its mission and has made its reputation through consistently fair and honest dealings. Under no circumstances will TS tolerate efforts by any employee to seek any personal advantage, or to seek any advantage on behalf of the School, through illegal or unethical practices. Each employee must endeavor to deal fairly at all times with other employees, faculty, students, parents, donors, business associates, the general public and all others with whom TS deals or has contact or communication. No employee should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any unfair dealing practice. Each employee owes a duty to TS to act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest and candid. Deceit and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity. Each employee must at all times:\n- act with integrity, including being honest and candid, while still maintaining the confidentiality of information where required, consistent with TS’s policies;\n- avoid conduct and situations that might create the appearance of dishonest, unethical or illegal behavior;\n- observe both the form and spirit of all applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations, accounting standards and TS’s policies; and\n- adhere to a high standard of ethics in all matters associated with the interests of the School\n\nConversely, each employee must avoid conduct that involves dishonesty or unethical behavior, creates the appearance of dishonesty or interferes with the employee’s objective, fair or effective conduct of his or her duties for TS. Such conduct may include, without limitation:\n- any situation where an individual’s private interest interferes with, or appears to interfere with, the interests of TS (including, without limitation, accepting kickbacks, having an interest in contracts with vendors, accepting excessive gifts from persons who have current or prospective dealings with TS, etc.);\n- failing to disclose the existence of a conflict of interest or apparent conflict of interest in writing and all facts material to the conflict of interest to the Head of School;\n- knowingly misrepresenting, or causing others to misrepresent, facts about the School to others, whether within or outside the School, including to the School’s independent auditors, governmental regulators, and self-regulatory organizations;\n- profiting from undisclosed information relating to the School or any other entity or organization with which TS has a business relationship;\n- taking advantage of (or directing to a third party) any business or other financial opportunity that is discovered through the use of any of TS’s property, or with the use of information obtained from TS, or by virtue of such person’s position with TS or using any such property, information or position for personal gain or in any way detrimental to the interests of TS;\n- inappropriately using or disclosing confidential information of TS, its affiliated entities, its employees, its students, alumni, donors, parents or other family members, customers, suppliers, or joint venture parties;\n- intentionally or recklessly damaging TS property;\n- dishonesty or unethical behavior in carrying out any employment duty, in dealing with colleagues, students or TS, in connection with any investigation, or in any activity involving TS; or\n- Exposing TS or its reputation to harm through dishonest, unethical or illegal conduct.\n- Gambling on school property\n- Possessing weapons, firearms, or ammunition on school property\n- Possessing, using, distributing, or being under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol at any time while conducting school business or while on school property.\n- Uttering, publishing, or distributing false, vicious, or malicious statements concerning the school or any of its employees, students, parents, or trustees\n\nLegal Compliance\nAt all times, it shall be TS’s policy to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. It is the personal responsibility of each employee to adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed by such laws, rules, and regulations.\n\nReporting and Accountability\nThe Head of School is responsible for the application and interpretation of this Code. Issues that involve allegations against or involving the Head of School may be reported directly to the President of the Board of Trustees. Any employee who becomes aware of any existing or potential violation of this Code is required to promptly notify the Head of School or the Board President in the manner provided by TS’s Employee Whistleblower Policy. The failure of any employee to notify the Head of School or the Board President of any such existing or potential violation will be considered a separate and independent violation of this Code subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment. Any questions relating to how this Code should be interpreted or applied should be addressed to the Head of School (or the Board President, as applicable). Retaliation against any person for making a good faith report of any actual or potential violation of this Code will not be tolerated. Such retaliation will be considered a separate and independent violation of this Code subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment. No employee should attempt to determine for himself or herself when a report of a violation of this Code was made “in good faith.” Rather, all such questions should be referred to and resolved by the Head of School (or by the Board President, as applicable). The Head of School (or Board President, as applicable) shall take all appropriate action or cause such action to be taken (through the Head of School or otherwise) to investigate any potential violations of the Code that are reported. When it is determined that a violation has occurred, TS will take such disciplinary, preventive or corrective action as it deems appropriate under the circumstances (to include discipline up to and including termination of the employment of culpable individuals).\n\nConfidentiality\nEmployees must maintain the confidentiality of all trade secrets and other confidential information of TS, its students, alumni, donors, parents and other family members, affiliated entities, customers, suppliers, or joint venture parties that is entrusted to them, except when disclosure is legally mandated or expressly authorized by TS. “Confidential information,” for this purpose, includes any proprietary or other non-public information of TS, or of other entities or organizations, or of any of the students, alumni, donors, parents and other family members that, if disclosed to persons not authorized to receive it, would be harmful to the relevant individual, entity or organization or detrimental to TS’s interests. Any employee who believes that any other confidential information must be disclosed because of legal requirements must consult with the Head of School and receive written confirmation that his or her understanding of the law is correct, before any such information is disclosed.\n\nUse of School Assets\nAll employees should protect TS’s assets and ensure their efficient use. All of TS’s assets should be used only for legitimate business purposes.\n\nLiability Prevention\nAll employees have a duty to avoid, whenever possible, any act or omission that would subject TS to unnecessary liability, contractual or otherwise. This duty includes not only the obligation to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations but also ensure that any representations to other employees, or to faculty, students, parents, contributors, vendors, suppliers, and/or business associates, or other third parties, are made in good faith. It shall be a violation of this Code for any employee to enter into any agreement that is legally binding upon TS without authority or without following required internal procedures for the approval of such agreements. Any questions concerning such procedures should be directed to the Head of School.`

        title: "Student - Employee Relationship",
        content: `As employees of an educational institution, faculty and staff are held to a higher standard by parents, students, colleagues, and members of the public. The school supports and endorses a strict policy of respect toward students and expects employees to act at all times as adult role models. Students typically respond better to faculty and staff and evidence greater levels of respect when appropriate expectations are established right from the beginning of the relationship. Therefore, faculty and staff members should not engage in any interaction or communication that may reflect even the appearance of impropriety or make students feel uncomfortable. If a faculty or staff member is not sure whether a particular comment or action may be appropriate, it is far better to avoid the behavior than risk negative consequences.\n\nThe following are examples of inappropriate interactions and communications with students. This list is not all-inclusive, and other, similar activities should also be avoided:\n- Calling students on their cell or home phone for non-school related matters;\n- Giving out or asking for other students’ phone numbers for use in situations other than for legitimate school reasons;\n- Encouraging or allowing students to call faculty or staff members by an inappropriate nickname;\n- Touching students or their clothing in non-professional ways or inappropriate places;\n- Making inappropriately personal comments to students (about their clothing, hair, nail polish, personal habits, etc.);\n- Sending emails, texts, or notes to students of a personal nature;\n- Inviting a student to visit social media sites and/or “Friending” a student on a social media;\n- Giving students rides, except in emergency or approved situations;\n- Discussing the personal affairs of other students or colleagues;\n- Speaking with innuendo to suggest a relationship or sexual subjects;\n- Flirting with students;\n- Visiting students to “hang out” in their hotel rooms on field trips or at sporting events;\n- Swearing, making inappropriate sexual, racial/or ethnic comments or telling inappropriate jokes;\n- Dating or engaging in romantic or sexual relationships with students.\n- Whenever with a student alone, ensure that windows are not covered and doors are open.\n\nIn addition, employees should never physically move, grab, or touch a student, or grab something from a student, with aggression or because of frustration. A teacher or staff member should never treat a student with anything less than respect and dignity. If a student does not follow directions as expected, employees should communicate clearly the instructions and, if the student does not listen or respond appropriately, appropriate action should be taken, which could include any number of responses, such as separating the student from the group; walking up to the student and ensuring that the student clearly sees you communicate with him/her; removing the student from the activity; communicating with the parent after the event; reporting the student to another appropriate TS authority, etc.\n\nMoreover, any employee who is also a parent of a student at TS is expected, when acting in a parental role or capacity, to address perceived problems or alleged inequities by other students (bullying, etc.) in the same way all other parents are to address such actions. Generally, the employee should report the problem to the appropriate administrator and should not take personal action to address the situation.\n\nAll employees are expected to take responsibility for the safety and welfare of students. If a faculty or staff member observes any employee, parent, volunteer or contractor engaging in any type of inappropriate or questionable behavior with a student or violating any aspect of this policy, he or she should report the information immediately to the student’s division head or the Head of School. In addition, as a part of every employee’s obligation to keep children and our campus safe, a teacher or staff member who receives information reflecting that any person who may regularly or periodically visit the school’s campus (student, employee, parent, spouse of an employee, family member, volunteer, or contractor) has engaged in behavior that could constitute abuse or neglect or has been accused, arrested, or convicted of any type of abuse, neglect, or sexual misconduct toward any other person must immediately report such information to a division head or the Head of School.\n\nAny employee who engages in behavior that violates this policy or who fails to report such activity by others will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.`

        content: `TS is a smoke-free, tobacco-free environment. This applies to everyone – students, administrators, faculty, staff, contractors, vendors, service personnel, and guests. TS prohibits the use of all tobacco products, including smokeless tobacco and “vapor” devices, on campus and in school vehicles with no exceptions. Violations of the smoke-free policy will result in disciplinary actions, up to and including termination of employment. It is the responsibility of those who invite guests or contract for services to make the policy known to all visitors to the campus.\n\nTS is committed to providing a safe work environment and to fostering the well-being and health of its employees. That commitment is jeopardized when an employee illegally uses drugs on the job, comes to work under the influence, possesses, distributes or sells illegal drugs in the workplace, or uses alcohol on the job.\n\nTS will not tolerate alcohol use or the use of other intoxicants and mind-altering substances, including illegal drugs. “Mind-altering” substances includes any type of substance ingested, snorted, smoked or inserted into one’s body that may impact the individual in some way. Such substances include, without limitation, alcohol, legal or illegal substances, over the counter salts, spices, vapors, incense, or other similar items.\n\nOur employees may be required to submit to drug screens, blood alcohol tests, breathalyzer tests and medical examinations under the following circumstances: a) when an employee is suspected of working or reporting to work with intoxicants or mind-altering substances in his or her system; b)when an employee suffers an on-the-job injury or is involved in an accident while at work; c) in connection with a routine fitness for duty examination; or (d) on a random basis. The presence of alcohol or the presence of any other intoxicants or mind-altering substances in the body is a violation of this policy, regardless of when consumption or ingestion occurred. Refusal of an employee to undergo testing or to cooperate fully with any of these tests is also a violation of our policy.\n\nOur employees are also prohibited from possessing, using, selling or purchasing any alcoholic beverages or other mind-altering substances in TS vehicles or on TS property. Off-premises possession, use, sale or purchase of mind-altering substances and off-premises alcohol use are also prohibited when conducting TS business or providing services on behalf of TS. This policy does not prohibit adults from light drinking at approved school-related functions, as long as the employee uses good judgment.\n\nNothing in this policy is meant to prohibit the appropriate use of over-the-counter medication or other medication that can legally be prescribed under both federal and state law, to the extent that it does not impair an employee's job performance or safety or the safety of others. Employees who take over-the-counter medication or other medication that can legally be prescribed under both federal and state law to treat a disability should inform their supervisor if they believe the medication will impair their job performance, safety, or the safety of others or if they believe they need a reasonable accommodation before reporting to work while under the influence of that medication. For more information on how to request a reasonable accommodation, please refer to the Disability Accommodations Policy.\n\nIt is the responsibility of TS's division heads and supervisors to counsel employees whenever they see changes in performance or behavior that suggest an employee has a substance abuse problem. Although it is not the supervisor’s job to diagnose personal problems, the supervisor should encourage such employees to seek help and advise them about available resources for getting help. Everyone shares responsibility for maintaining a safe work environment, and co-workers should encourage anyone who has a suspected substance abuse problem to seek help. Employees should note, however, that if the supervisor suspects that the employee has reported to work with mind-altering substances in his/her system, and the employee tests positive, the employee would be terminated in accordance with this policy.\n\nTS considers alcoholism and drug addiction to be medical problems and treats them as such. If you are suffering from alcoholism or drug addition, we encourage you to seek treatment through the group medical plan coverage. Participation in any treatment program will not jeopardize your future employment or advancement nor will it protect you from disciplinary action from substandard job performance or rule infractions due to your continued use of alcohol or other drugs.\n\nThe goal of this policy is to balance our respect for individuals with the need to maintain a safe and productive environment. The intent of the policy is to offer a helping hand to those who need it, while sending a clear message that the illegal use of any substance is incompatible with employment at TS.\n\nAs a condition of employment, employees must abide by the terms of this policy and must notify TS in writing of any conviction of a violation of a criminal drug statute, including a ‘guilty’ or ‘nolo contendere’ plea, no later than five calendar days after such conviction.\n\nViolation of any aspect of this Policy will result in discipline up to and including immediate termination. In order to determine whether this Policy has been violated, TS may examine all evidence available to it, including without limitation, the employee being arrested for alcohol or drug related offenses. In addition, TS may report use, sale or possession concerns to the civil authorities.`

        content: `TS prohibits possession of guns, firearms, knives, archery-type devices, stun guns, objects capable of firing a projectile, or martial arts devices on TS’s property, including the school’s parking lot.\n\nTS will not tolerate threats, implied threats, harassment, or aggressive or violent behavior by employees or visitors. Threats can take many forms, including showing of weapons, telephone calls, physical altercations, letters, email, vandalism, following/stalking, face-to-face conversations, and assaults/batteries. Any form of physical harassment is prohibited. Physical harassment could include any physical conduct such as hitting, pushing, or other aggressive physical contact; touching, gesturing, or otherwise threatening to make aggressive physical contact; or displaying threatening literature, signs, or pictures.\n\nIf you encounter threats, harassing behavior, acts of violence, or aggressive conduct, you should immediately report this to your supervisor, the Head of School or any other member of management with whom you feel comfortable.\n\nIf TS receives any complaint of workplace threats, harassment or violence, it will conduct a full investigation immediately. Violation of this policy will result in discipline, up to and including termination.`
